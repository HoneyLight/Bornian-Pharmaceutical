1--- I just updated the bookbtn button function with the
 submit onlcick function put it outside the form so that I won't have to do a preventDefault 
function becuase at some point it stopped working so I had to change that.

2--- I updated the bornianDoctors object with specialization of the given 
     doctors just so the patient can print out the invoice and know the specialty
     the doctor has.

3--- I changed the if else statement to a switch statement and made the default condition be an 
     alert, that notifies the user of not filling the inputs, if the other cases are met 
     of coourse we can proceed with the program.
   
4--- On any specialization the patient selects there is a doctor that stands to defend it.



    THINGS THAT ARE REMAINING... 

1. If a user selects the date and time and another user has selected that same kind of time and day
   there should be an alert that pops up and says that the doctor has been booked, wherever the patient is 
   that doctor should throw that alert.
  
2. The date and time should work alongside this.
